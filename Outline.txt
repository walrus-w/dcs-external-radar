Export all units, their positions and vectors, pass this to compiled and well-optimised program
This program, radar.dll for argument's sake, processes the contacts according to the parameters of the radar
Let the source file for this be bars-m.hxx; within which the behaviour of the radar is defined.
Thus, the raw data returned by DCS is passed via a lua interface to the external radar simulation
The input will therein be processed according to a model of the radar
Output from the radar simulation will be passed to an interface with the simulation for display
In this way, it may be possible to circumvent limitations in the public API, bypassing almost entirely DCS itself.
Immediate predicates:
- There must be a way to continuously update an external file with the position/vector of each sim object
    - This is certainly possible via the mission scripting API
- It must be possible for DCS to call an external program which is optimised to efficiently run an
 as-realistic-as-possible and then accept return values.
    At present, I am unsure if this is possible.
    If it is not, it may be feasible to build a radar simulation which runs within the mission scripting environment
    This itself may not play nicely with multiplayer.
- Currently I am unsure as to the aspects of this related to actually displaying data in the cockpit
- Assuming these conditions can be met, the most complex aspect of implementation will likely be in understanding the
 working of a PESA radar system sufficiently well to represent it algorithmically. Clearly, even an 'ideal'
 implementation would be a rough analogue, given the lack of any but the most general specifications in the public
 domain.
- Computational complexity may be an important consideration, given the scan rate of the radar.
    - Potentially, a workable model would sort input into categories, starting with two:
     <cannot-be-detected> and <can-be-detected>, defined geometrically by the scan azimuth, elevation and maximum
     possible detection range
    - Those in the former category would be discarded immediately, whilst the latter further processed.
    - Depending upon the granularity of the model, <can-be-detected> might be passed through multiple 'filter'
     functions, each of which would remove elements in accordance with a given property of the
     radar beam, e.g. range from emitter.
    - An alternative model, embodying a similar approach would be to modify a single value for a given contact,
     being the percentage chance of detection, further abstracting physical properties e.g. RCS
    - Important point for consideration: the above would likely involve considerable iteration per detectable object;
     This would pin minimum computational complexity relatively high.
    - Might a database/lookup table provide a more efficient solution whilst retaining the maximum possible
     physical fidelity? Almost certainly.
    - At least initially, modelling of ground interference would be relatively simplistic.

Possible Class Hierarchy for Radar:
- class Radar
    - data members:
    - class Antenna
    - class Transmitter
    - class Receiver
    - class SignalProcessor // this is going to be the complicated part
    - class LiquidCoolingUnit // not necessary for basic implementation, but this is the component which limits output wattage
    - float required-voltage // each component of Radar would include a function to return it's power usage
    - all of the above derived from class Component
